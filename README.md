The following scripts are added to enable wallfollowing remotely.
The Raspberry Pi Zero on the robot, has been setup to join an AdHoc wireless 
network with IP 192.168.99.4
SSID - pibot

The scripts are started via RC.local at startup.

 - CamJam Edukit 3 - GPIO Zero/Code/server.sh       - Server which processes commands and returns data.
 - CamJam Edukit 3 - GPIO Zero/Code/startserver.sh  - Is run at startup by RC.local to start socat server.
 - CamJam Edukit 3 - GPIO Zero/Code/rigtig.py       - The code that controls the robot wallfollower.


The robot accepts the following commands:
echo "start" | socat - tcp:192.168.99.4:8080 - Start the robot
echo "stop" | socat - tcp:192.168.99.4:8080 - Stops the robot
echo "getDist" | socat - tcp:192.168.99.4:8080 - Returns the measurement from ultrasound sensor
echo "getMotors" | socat - tcp:192.168.99.4:8080 - Returns the motor values Left and Right respectively.
